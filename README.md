# Accelerating the Advanced Encryption Standard Algorithm and Implementing Modified AES Algorithm
To accelerate the AES algorithm on FPGA and compare the speedup with both AES and Modified AES algorithms.

## Deliverables Aimed 
- Accelerating the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and Modified AES algorithms on FPGA. Implementation using Verilog (including Test benches).
- Wrapping the design using Microblaze/Zynq with AXI interface. 
- C codes to provide input text and for obtaining encrypted output text.
- Comparing the speedup using our PC.
