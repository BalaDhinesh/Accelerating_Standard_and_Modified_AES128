Getting timing problems in both using ILA and Microblaze
Make use of clk and reset signal
Make the IP of AES which has an enable signal
Pipeline AES
Do with Modified AES
no more problems with minicom(sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB1, sudo minicom -s)
uart port dont use 9600(data leakage)
microblaze set local memory as high as possible(128KB) - 16KB not working, not efficeint(problem using xil_printf)
Report timing and area carefully
Vitis serial terminal not working good
In Windows, to get serial port access denied(donno how)
In nolan colon link, 10 cycles for AES(100MHz) and 2000 cycles(2.9GHz Laptop)
Watch Prof.Nitin lectures on FFT Accelerator for reference
Avalanche effect calculation
